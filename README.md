**Pop Connect Entitas** is a dynamic mobile game prototype developed using the **Entitas Framework**, a powerful Entity Component System (ECS) for Unity. This game showcases advanced ECS concepts and performance optimizations in Unity, aiming to provide a highly responsive gaming experience.

## Entitas Framework
Developed with the [Entitas ECS Framework](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp), which is known for its high performance and scalability in game development. This framework helps to organize game design into clean, modular components and systems.
